                                <p>We as humans construct stories to make sense of the world around us. If several of us agree with a story, it becomes a collective reality and framework within which to interact with each other. We at Eart Benign have re-examined our stories of money and of food. Alternative money is our story arc, while food security is our first episode within that story arc.</p>
                                <p>On this page, we'll explain EarthBenign's story of money and our core product by referring to the story of Anton the Baker in "A Medieval Tale". One by one, we'll go through various features described in "A Medieval Tale" and we'll highlight the symmetric counterparts of those features which we've designed into our own 21st century New Age money system. This will work, we hope, to help you get a general idea of our product.</p>

We spent these 18 months learning personally from Paul a variety of monetary reform theories and, for is here at Earthbenign, "A Medieval Tale" also serves as an animated explanation of our own core product, The EarthForwards & OrganiCoin money system.

                      A foundational idea that needs to be understood in this product narrative, and we'll expand upon this further downstream, is that the economy is a vast array of supply chains. Even Anton the Baker's medieval marketplace, as you can see here in this snapshot at 2:03, functions as a supply chain, as you'll read further along.

                <p>
                We’ve expanded upon “A Medieval Tale” greatly in terms ofmappingthe monetary system to and integrating with a local & organic <i>retailer's</i> food supply chain.<br>
                In this screenshot, starting at 2:40, it is mentioned that all participants in the marketplace are both producers and consumers.<br>
                This is another way to say that this is a vast array of <i>supply chains</i>. <br>
                So why is EarthBenign mapping the EarthForwards system to supply chains of local & organic retailers? Well, we’ve done this in order to solve the chicken and the egg <a href="http://www.coelevate.com/essays/the-network-effect-marketplaces">(see link here)</a> problem of the “network effect”. In supply chains, actors are alreadyinteracting with each other so we don’t need to convince them to do so. Network effect “chicken and egg” problem solved!

                In this product narrative "A Medieval Tale", the terminology of "self-issued credit" is used as the basic unit of financial dynamic. EarthBenign believes that nomenclature is very important, and for a variety of reasons, we've decided not to use the nomenclature of "self-issued credit" in our own EarthForward & OrganiCoin product offering. We note that a financial contract is being issued and transacted, and we identify it as a "Forward contract", which is a type of Derivative, which in turn is a financial contract that derives its value from some underlying asset, such as a commodity or an index. The "vouchers" mentioned later on in "A Medieval Tale" are really Forward contracts.

                    <p>
                      Here at 3:53 we see Anton issuing a voucher that is good for one fourth of a silver penny towards the purchase of Anton's bread. This "voucher" is what we call an "EarthForward", and in fact, the voucher is indeed a type of Forward Contract. Later on this page, we'll show you a demo of our EarthBenign Brokers Platform (known as "EB9-BP" for short) where producers can log in and issue EarthForwards very similarly to how Anton here is issuing his vouchers.

Similarly, in the EarthBenign system, our unit of value is the OrganiCoin.<br>
                      The OrganiCoin is a value unit in that it isn't a real "thing" just like an "inch" or a "pound" is not a real thing. They are mathematical constructs, ultimately imaginary. With us and OraganiCoin, the mathematical construct is an imaginary basket of 37 globally significant commodities,<a href="http://www.rogersrawmaterials.com"> known as the RICI basket.</a> EarthForwards issued in our system are valued in multiples of OrganiCoins. The elegance behind this is that the US Dollar value of the RICI index serves as a reliable gateway (or "foreign exchange rate") to convert OrganiCoins into US Dollars. This keeps our monetary system relatively stable and not subject to violent fluctuations.

                <p>
                In this scene at 6:29, what we’re witnessing here in the “Medieval Tale” is really an Over The Counter (OTC) Derivatives Exchange. What is an OTC exchange? The “vouchers” are really a type of Forward contract which is a type of commodity Derivative. They are being listed in one organized marketplace. Here the person wearing the “Voucher Exchange Coach” is the medieval counterpart to our own EB9EX, which is an organized marketplace, or Exchange, i.e. a massively scaled ledger that keeps track, in real-time, of who has control over which voucher, and dynamically routes control of vouchers based on incoming transaction requests.

        <div class="col-md-6">    
             <h3><strong>Fragmentability - use fragments as units of currency!</strong></h3>
        
                    <p>
                      It’s not overtly mentioned in “A Medieval Tale” so we’ll highlight a key feature here: we’re making the vouchers fragmentable. Imagine Anton the Baker “making change” for vouchers, or even simpler, fragmenting out the change he needs and using the fragments as money. Imagine cutting up the vouchers into as many pieces as you needed to and using each cut up fragment as a unit of currency! Fragments of each voucher retain all attributes of the voucher from which it is fragmented and so they have a fractal quality. By 'fractal' quality, we mean that all attributes (such as issuer, redemption date, underlying asset, etc) of each fragment are self-similar across different scales, with only the monetary value of each fragment varying across scales.<br>
                      This voucher is worth one fourth of a Silver Penny towards the purchase of Anton's bread. But remember, Anton issued a total of 20 silver pennies worth of vouchers,as is mentioned at 3:50. What that means is,if he issued one fourth of a silver penny fragments,then the total number of fragments he issued is calculated as follows:<br>
                      1/4 x 4 = 1 Silver Penny, and since he issued 20 silver pennies worth of vouchers, the total number of "1/4th of a Silver Penny" Voucher fragments he issued is 4 x 20 = 80 vouchers.<br>
                      What's more, with EarthBenign's system, he could fragment the 1/4th of a silver penny voucher even further (digitally of course) down to the 7th decimal place.

             <h3><strong>The Broker's Role</strong></h3>
        
                    <p>
                      How could we make “A Medieval Tale” even more efficient?<br>
                Well, imagine the marketplace itself being located on the premises of a benign retailer who serves as the nucleus and hub of activity.<br>
                Imagine these retailers serving a dual role as brokers in that they’d be a class of members of the Exchange seen at 6:29 with special responsibilities. These responsibilities would include:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Taking EarthForwrd (i.e. voucher) transaction orders, packaging them as requests, and routing these requests to the Exchange</li>
                  <li>Setting producers’ voucher issuing limits based on verifications of their production capability</li>
                  <li>Ensuring the vouchers being issued are in compliance and are in proper format</li>
                </ul>
                Each producer and consumer will have to subscribe to one of the EB9EX’s broker-member’s services in order to participate in the system, much like in order to transact on the NYSE or Nasdaq, one has to open an account with one of its member-brokers like Schwab or Etrade.<br>
                So, how would brokers make their services available to their subscribing producers and consumers? We’ve thought of that and have already coded up a prototype to demonstrate! We call it the EarthBenign Brokers’ Platform or “EB9-BP” for short. Here you’ll find two links – one takes you to the EB9-BP prototype itself where you can create an account, log in, and interact with the broker’s services. The other takes you to a screencasted video explaining the various functionalities in the context of the “Medieval Tale” product narrative.
